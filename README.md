# 4 Bit CPU Design 
This a project for designing a 4 bit CPU in SystemVerilog along with a small memory module as a part of the 7 day system verilog challenge. The CPU design is able to execute instruction sets which is inspired from RISC-V ISA. The data patha and controle unit is designed along with a memory which stores the instruction set and the data, with read, write functionality. The whole desing is verified using a testbench written in SV.
